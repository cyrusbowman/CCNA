Credit Card Nicknames for Amazon Chrome Extension

# Description
This is a small extension built after getting frustrated with the fact that Amazon doesn't allow you to give nicknames to your credit cards.
It was made for just the US site but could easily be adapted for other domains if there is any demand.

# Install
The extension can be found here: [Chrome Webstore] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/credit-card-nicknames-for/iodihdkgnjbpkdimohmpgbcfoioebbnf "Credit Card Nicknames for Amazon Chrome Extension")
