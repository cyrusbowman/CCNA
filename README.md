Credit Card Nicknames for Amazon Chrome Extension

# Description
This is a small extension built after getting frustrated with the fact that Amazon doesn't allow you to give nicknames to your credit cards. It will sync them across your google account.

It was made for just the US site but could easily be adapted for other domains if there is any demand.

# Install
The extension can be found here: [Chrome Webstore] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/credit-card-nicknames-for/iodihdkgnjbpkdimohmpgbcfoioebbnf "Credit Card Nicknames for Amazon Chrome Extension")

# Security
The extension does not store the 4 digit numbers of the credit card, instead using a hash to associate the nickname with the card number.
